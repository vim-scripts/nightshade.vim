NightShade uses a black background with bright highlighting.
NightShade_Print uses similar colors but is designed for printing.

I put the macro below in my .vimrc file to allow a single key
to change to the nightshade_print colorization, print, then change back.

   map <F1> :colorscheme nightshade_print<CR> :hardcopy<CR> :colorscheme nightshade<CR>
